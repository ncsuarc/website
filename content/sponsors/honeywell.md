Honeywell invents and manufactures technologies and services that deliver save,
productive, and efficient experiences in the fields of aerospace, automation
and control, performance materials, and transportation systems.

Honeywell sponsored ARC with an HMR2350 magnetometer. This interfaces perfectly
with the Piccolo autopilot to provide high-fidelity 3D magnetic field data
which is used for gyro bias correction and magnetic heading determination.
