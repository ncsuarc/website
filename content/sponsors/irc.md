IRC is a provider of high quality commercial infrared imaging systems.  IRC
caters their systems for scientific, industrial, and military applications.
IRC offers cameras across all infrared wavelengths, both from their own IR
series, as well as from third-party manufacturers.

IRC provided DRS Tamarisk 320 and 640 IR cameras to ARC for R&amp;D use and
exploration of IR camera integration into our payload and mission.
