Vess Propellers is a popular choice for custom, high-performance propellers for
RC applications. Vess Propellers provides propellers that bring unmatched
levels of performance as a result of their extensive design and testing.

Vess Propellers sponsors ARC with the propellers used on both our ARCWulf and
Fenrir airframes. The Vess 23A on Fenrir provides efficient power with low prop
noise, and an excellent balance of low-end thrust for short takeoffs and
climbout with efficient cruise performance.
