An up-and-coming entry into the UAS industry, Airware is developing a line of
autopilots to suit anything from micro vehicles to multicopters to large UAV's.
They feature open-source software, a 1GHz Linux computer built in, and enough
interfaces to make integration with nearly any payload easy.

Airware sponsors ARC with their osFlexPilot autopilot and development system.
