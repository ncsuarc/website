## The Club

The Aerial Robotics Club at NC State is a student organization that brings
excellent students together to do excellent work. We build custom airframes,
install custom electronics, write custom software, and integrate everything
together into a world-ranking UAS.

Our member base consists primarily of undergraduate students at NC State, along
with a few graduate student advisors.  Our members come from many different
majors, including Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering,
Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science. Our club welcomes all, regardless
of major. We seek out students with a passion for learning new things, and
applying that knowledge to solve difficult challenges.
