### Let's Get In Touch!

If you're a student interested in joining our club, a company looking to sponsor us, or you just want to get more information about what we're doing, get in touch with us.

If you are at NC State, please feel free to stop by our lab. We are in room 2003 in Engineering Building III on NCSU's Centennial Campus. There is typically at least one or two people in the lab Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm.

Our meeting time for the Fall 2017 semester is Wednesdays at 6:30pm.

If you are not at NC State, or just want to send us a quick question, feel free to send us an email at [contact@aerialroboticsclub.com](mailto:contact@aerialroboticsclub.com).
